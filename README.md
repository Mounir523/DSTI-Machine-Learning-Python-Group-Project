Members : Abdoulkader, Josselin, Lavanya and Mounir

This workspace contains our work on the Python ML Lab course Project 1 : Book's rating prediction.

The main Branch contains the final version of our Python Notebook.
The input data necessary can be found in the Input Folder, it contains a csv file (books.csv) which has been slightly modified manually by the team.
See also our report in pdf which briefly explain our work.

You can direcly run the notebook file, if a library cannot be imported please install it (pip install).
For the notebook to run normally the Input folder with the CSV file need to be placed at the root of the notebook file.
